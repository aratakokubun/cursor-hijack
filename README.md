## How to use cursor-hijack?

1. install cursor-hijack with npm
Currently I am not registering. Please wait for it.
```
npm install cursor-hijack --save
```

2. Add 2 react components to your application.

You need to pass function to CursorHijackOverlay to get Refs under application.

```app.js(for exapmle)
  // Import components from cursor-hijack
  import cjk from 'cursor-hijack';
  ...

  // Pass function to get refs under app.js
  const getAppRefs = () => (this.refs)

  ...
  const render = () => {
    return
      <div>
        <cjk.PseudoCursor />
        <cjk.CursorHijackOverlay
          getAppRefs={this.getAppRefs} />
        <!-- other components -->
        <Component1 />
        <Component2 />
        ...
      <div>
  }
  ...
```

3. Put refs tags for components inside.

This library search elements with ref tag to dispatch event.
In app.js and same manner for all child components.

```
  ...
  <div>
    <ChildComponent1 ref="child1"> Good! </ChildComponent1>
    <ChildComponent2> Bad! You should not do this! </ChildComponent2>
    <button ref="button1"> Good! </button>
    <div>
      <ChildComponent3 ref="child3"> Good! </ChildComponent3>
      <button ref="button2"> Good! </button>
    </div>
  </div>
  ...
```

To add to this, you need to specify { withRef: true } for comoponets which use connect.
```
  connect(mapStateFunc, mapDispatchFunc, mergeFunc, { withRef: true } /*Need option*/)(Component1)
```

4. Create store for cursor-hijack reducers
      
```
let store = createStore(CursorHijack.Reducers);
let rootElement = document.getElementById('app')

render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <div>
      <App />
    </div>
  </Provider>,
  rootElement
)
```
    
5. Create and set your own distoreter.
 
This is most important and difficult part.
Read instruction below and refert to samples.

## Customize

## Restrictions

1. Default (real) cursor will be shown on dialogs(e.g. alert).

Cursor-hijack hide default cursor where cursor-hijack-overlay covers, but it does not cover dialog.  
If you want REALITY for a pseudo cursor, recommend not to use them.
  
2. Some actions for ui component do not occur(e.g. select test in input).

Cursor-hijack does not support some actions for ui components.
I do not have any solutions for it.
If you want to use it, please wait for update, sorry.

## Future improvements

  - Distort cursor periodically even while no mouse events occur.
  - Add more samples.
    - I am now planning to create interactive UI combined with gl sl!
  - Remove listed restrictions!
